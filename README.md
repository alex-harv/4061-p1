# Edit this README, 
which should contain the following
information:
● Project group number

● Group member names and x500s

● The name of the CSELabs computer that you tested your code on

  ○ e.g. csel-kh1250-01.cselabs.umn.edu

● Any changes you made to the Makefile or existing files that would affect grading

● Plan outlining individual contributions for each member of your group

● Plan on how you are going to implement the process tree component of creating the Merkle tree
(high-level pseudocode would be acceptable/preferred for this part)


# task is to implement the partition_file_data() function in src/utils and come up with a plan on how you are going to implement the rest of the project.

128B <= Input file size <= 128MB
1 <= N <= 128
Input file size >= N
The length of a file path will be < 1024 characters (bytes)
Use PATH_MAX when creating char arrays for file names
All processes have access to the output/ folder
You should be using fork(), wait(), and exec() to create the Merkle tree using a process tree
If you are dynamically allocating memory, make sure to free it
